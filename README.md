## Personal Growth

Songsterr is a website for an upcoming guitar players. It lets you choose type of chords you want to learn and plays alogn with you. The task was to connect to public API and create a soft of search engine for that would return said song and the available chords to learn. Even though I was to late to provide app to the employer, they were kind enough to make some suggestions on how to make the code more readable. For sure I need to refactor it using React Hooks!
